# NGA Moodle: Enrolling a Student in a Course

1. Login to [https://nga.moodlehub.com/](https://nga.moodlehub.com/)
2. On left sidebar, click `Site home`
3. In the main content area, navigate to the course \(e.g. click `Language` and then `Hebrew I`\)
4. On the left sidebar, click `Participants`
5. On the right side of the screen, click `Enrol users`
6. Next to `Select users`, use the `Search` box to find and select the student\(s\) you want to enroll
7. `Assign role` should already be set to `Student`, so click the blue `Enrol users` button

Now when the student logs in, they will see the course and be able to access it.

\(Note: In case you're curious, "Enrol" is the UK spelling, "Enroll" is the US spelling\)
