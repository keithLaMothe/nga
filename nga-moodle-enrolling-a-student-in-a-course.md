# Assigning a User to a Course

This guide is for Site Administrators, and can be used to assign a teacher to a course they did not create or to enroll a student in a course.

1. Login to [https://nga.moodlehub.com/](https://nga.moodlehub.com/) .
2. On left sidebar, click `Site home`.
3. In the main content area, navigate to the course \(e.g. click `Language` and then `Hebrew I`\).
4. On the left sidebar, click `Participants`.
5. On the right side of the screen, click `Enrol users`.
6. Next to `Select users`, use the `Search` box to find and select the desired user\(s\).
7. If you are assigning a teacher to this course, select `Teacher` for `Assign role`. If you are enrolling a student in this course, select `Student`.
8. Click the blue `Enrol users` button.

Now when the teacher or student logs in, he will see the course and be able to access it.

\(Note: In case you're curious, "Enrol" is the UK spelling, "Enroll" is the US spelling\)
